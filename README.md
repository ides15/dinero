# Dinero

Dinero is a tool for managing money. Didn't like any of the other million money applications, so I'm building this.

This is also being used as an opportunity to learn Go; the API for Dinero is build using Go and the Chi router.

The UI for Dinero will be built in React.

The delivery of Dinero will be from a Docker container. The end goal will be to pull down the Dinero image and run it as a container to interact with it (just like `ides15/tupperware`).

Also learning TDD with Go.
